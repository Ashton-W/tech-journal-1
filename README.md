============

This journal is a collection of short notes on software development topics, based on findings I made during my day to day work.

## Notes to self

To create a new post run `rake new post-name-goes-here`

## Commit message template

`Language/Technology: A description of the post`, note how both the language or technology name and the first word after it should be capitalised. Also use `iOS` instead of `ios`.
