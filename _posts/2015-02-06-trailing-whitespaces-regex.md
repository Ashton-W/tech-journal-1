title: A RegEx to highlight trailing whitespaces in Vim

Today I had a very interesting chat with [Timothy Mukaibo](https://twitter.com/TimothyMukaibo) about vim, and of course we ended up exchanging `.vimrc` tips.

One of the interesting bits of his `.vimrc` is that any extra whitespace at the end of a line are highlighted. I found this very useful and added it to mine straightaway!

The extra whitespaces are picked through a RegEx, and in my ongoing quest to sharpen my RegEx skills I'm now gonna look at it:

```
/\s\+\$/
```

* `\s` is the matcher for a single whitespace character
* `\+` is the "greedy" one or more quantifier
* `\$` matches the end of the line

Summing it all up we get "match one or more whitespace characters at the end of the line", which is exactly what we want.

### Food for thoughts

* Understand the syntax used to set this in the `.vimrc`
* Understand why if the `hi` instruction comes after the `match` one then the trick doesn't work
* Try to find out if it's possible to have it running only in normal mode
